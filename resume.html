  <p>I can already hear you asking. "Why would you put a resume on a site with the purpose of cataloguing the activities of Dan Hentschel?" Simple. Two reasons. The first being that the Orb's effects are wide-reaching and extreme. While this site archives his content and activities, it serves as a touchstone for my own history. We've seen it change his. This will help me remember my own. Second, it's clearly documented that Dan has government agents monitoring him, as I am. Should they need an agency dedicated to this task, this will serve to skip any formalities of an interview or application. They know where I am and may approach me at any time.</p>

  <p>(Yes, the whole Orb thing is a joke. Figured I'd have some fun with my site. Vaguely based on true things though, so keep watching the skies or something like that.)
